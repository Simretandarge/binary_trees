0x1D. C - Binary trees

The general-purpose programming language C is effective. The creation of software such as operating systems, databases, compilers, and other tools is possible with it. The ideas of binary trees are covered in this project! We gained knowledge on the specifics, benefits, and drawbacks of employing trees as data structures through this collaborative initiative. In addition to learning how to navigate them, we also studied how to classify trees. We used binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees throughout the project.

At the end of this project, We were able to undesrtand these questions:

What is a binary tree
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
